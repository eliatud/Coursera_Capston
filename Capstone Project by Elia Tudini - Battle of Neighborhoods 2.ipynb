    "##### With This final project explores I want to understand the best locations for Italian restaurants throughout the city of Vancouver. According to the Government of Canada, todya 1.8 millions canadians have italian orgining, due to a big wave of immigration from the county from the second world war until the 1970s This report explores which neighborhoods and boroughs of Vancouver have the most as well as the best Italian restaurants. Additionally, I will attempt to answer the questions “Where should I open an Italian Restaurant?” and “Where should I stay If I want great Italian food?”"
